Just click the red button before the ten second countdown reaches zero. It’s pretty easy, but I have a feeling you’ll somehow mess this up.

That took longer than it needed to.
Don’t be so smug, you just pressed a button.
I’ve seen better button pressing by Captain Hook.
Do you have a cramp in your finger? That might explain your performance.
So you clicked the button. How about next time you click it well?
I pity that button, you clicked it so poorly.
That was a boring click. Let’s move on to the next one.
Could you at least try to click the button decently?
This barely passes as a button click.
Your button clicking is just plain embarrassing.

That was awful to look at, but then again, I didn’t expect any better.

Alright, you managed to complete it. Don’t let it go to your head, almost everyone does it.
