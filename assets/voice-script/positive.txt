Please click the red button before the ten second countdown reaches zero. The countdown will reset each time you do. Can you do it without letting the countdown reach zero? We believe in you.

Amazing! You clicked that button straight down!
Wow! Are you a professional button clicker?
You just might be the Tiger Woods of button clicking.
Great button clicking, can’t wait to show this recording to the guys at the lab.
Awesome, I could watch you click buttons all day.
I’m not sad, those are tears of joy. The joy of watching you click that button.
If this was the Olympics you would get a gold medal for that button clicking.
I’m speechless.
I’ve never seen such raw button pressing talent.
Watching you press the button makes my job worth it.

Don’t feel bad, you did an amazing job. No one could have done better.
Terrific effort! I’m sure you’ll do even better next time

You did it! I had high expectations of you, yet you surpassed them at every turn!
